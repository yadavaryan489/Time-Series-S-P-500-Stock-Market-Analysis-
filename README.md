# Time-Series-S-&-P-500-Stock-Market-Analysis

## Project Overview

Welcome to the "Time Series (S & P 500 Stock Market Analysis)" project. This project offers a comprehensive analysis of the S & P 500 stock market using time series data. We employ Python and key data analysis libraries to unlock insights within the financial markets.

## Stock Data

We've gathered a diverse range of stock data to conduct our analysis, exploring different stocks within the S & P 500 index. All the dataset are provide in the zip fle

## Problem Statement

In this case study, we focus on various aspects of stock market analysis, including:

- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Price Change Analysis Over Time
- Moving Average Analysis
- Analysis of Apple Inc.'s Closing Prices
- Resampling Analysis (Monthly, Quarterly, Weekly, Yearly, and Daily)
- Multivariate Analysis to Uncover Stock Correlations
- In-Depth Correlation Analysis Using Histograms, Scatter Plots, and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)

For detailed code explanations and analysis, please refer to the accompanying Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) files within the repository. 
Our primary IDE is Jupyter Notebook.

## Modules Used

We've harnessed the power of several Python libraries for this analysis, including but not limited to:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Seaborn
- Plotly.graph_objects
- Glob
- Warnings
- Plotly.express

## Graphs and Visualizations

Our analysis is complemented by a variety of visually engaging graphs and visualizations, such as:

- Line Plots
- Candlestick OHLC Charts
- Scatter Plots
- Pairplots with Histograms and Scatter Plots
- Heatmaps
- PairGrid
- Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
- Histograms

Thank you for exploring this project! Feel free to dive into the code and analysis to better understand the fascinating world of the S & P 500 stock market.
